### CPSC 120

* Lab 1

    Lab 1 was one of my favorite labs because it was my first time ever coding 
    using visual studio and I was able to learn how to clone repositories and
    was able to learn basic starting commands like std::cout, in order to print
    overall it was a great learning experience.

* Lab 6

    Lab 6 was also one of my favorite labs because it was one of the first 
    experiences I had with having a little bit of struggle coding and we had to 
    go back and check notes in order to learn the coding. Overall we struggled
    a lot with pushing and getting the correct sandwhich ingredients for the 
    testing.

* Lab 7

    Last but not least Lab 7 was one of my favorites because growing up I've 
    always played blackjack with my family and it is probably my favorite card 
    game and it was a great experience learning how to code blackjack in order 
    for it run properly.
