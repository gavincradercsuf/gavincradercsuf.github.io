### CPSC 120

* Lab 1

    Lab 1 was one of my favorite labs because it was my first time ever coding 
    using visual studio and I was able to learn how to clone repositories and
    was able to learn basic starting commands like std::cout, in order to print
    overall it was a great learning experience.

* Lab 6

    Lab 6 was also one of my favorite labs because it was one of the first 
    experiences I had with having a little bit of struggle coding and we had to 
    go back and check notes in order to learn the coding. Overall we struggled
    a lot with pushing and getting the correct sandwhich ingredients for the 
    testing. Overall we were able to learn a good variety of commands like 
    stringing and initializing something.

* Lab 7

    Lab 7 was a great lab that we were able to do. I enjoyed learning new 
    commands like std:err to return the errors and overall I learned what 
    return 1; did for the first time. I believe the lab was king of cool with
    the whole hour system and was very challenging.
